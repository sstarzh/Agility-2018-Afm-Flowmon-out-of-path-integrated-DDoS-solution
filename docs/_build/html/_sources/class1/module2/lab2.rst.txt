Initiate DDoS attack
====================

Run SYN flood (hping3) from Attacker VM
---------------------------------------

-  From Attacker VM SSH session run SYN flood towards Web server

    Run *‘syn\_flood’* script

    |image9|

-  Observe traffic growth in both Router1 and Router2. After 10-15
   seconds traffic will drop in Router2 due to DDoS detection and
   mitigation start

DDoS mitigation start
---------------------

An *ACTIVE* attack with the new ID will appear in Flowmon DDoS defender
‘Active attacks’ screen. Flowmon dynamically provisions AFM DDoS profile
and VS, and initiates traffic diversion to AFM using BGP advertisement

BGP route change and traffic drop
---------------------------------

-  Router1 shows new route to protected *10.1.30.0/24* subnet

    Type *‘show ip bgp’*

    |image13|

-  As traffic is being routed through AFM, Router2 shows no significant
   network activity while Router1 still experiences high traffic load

AFM DDoS profile and virtual server
-----------------------------------

Flowmon is using iControl REST interface to provision necessary
parameters in AFM

-  Navigate to Security->DoS protection->DoS profiles and confirm that
   the DoS profile has been provisioned for the protected subnet

    |image15|

-  In Local Traffic->Virtual Servers->Virtual Server List confirm that
   VS with corresponding Attack ID has been created

    |image16|

AFM DDoS mitigation
-------------------

In AFM TMUI navigate to Security->DoS Protection-> DoS Overview and
confirm that AFM is performing DoS mitigation using the provisioned DoS
profile
