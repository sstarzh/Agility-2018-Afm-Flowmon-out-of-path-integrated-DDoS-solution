Deployment use case
===================

A Joint F5 + Flowmon solution is deployed “out-of-path” and provides an
out-of-band DDoS mitigation of L3-4 volumetric DDoS attacks. It’s a
simple and convenient solution that leverages the existing IT
infrastructure to provide traffic flow information.

Flowmon Collector appliance receives NetFlow/sFlow/IPFIX from edge
routers while Flowmon DDoS Defender uses i/eBGP/Flowspec to route the
traffic to F5 DHD/AFM appliance. F5 DHD/AFM DDoS profile, VS and other
parameters provisioned dynamically through iControl REST.
